# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This app allows users to search for books that inside the database to get information such as title, author, publication year, rating. The user will also be able to access the reviews he/she has made or leave one.

I opt to go for a simple bootstrap style for the app.

forms.py:
in the forms.py are the form classes that are used in the project. I used WTForms to make validation easier

import.py:
import.py is used to create the tables necessary for the app and load the books.csv data into the database

the static pages are placed in the templates directory which inherents from layout.html
